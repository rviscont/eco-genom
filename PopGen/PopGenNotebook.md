### Entry 1: 2023-09-11.

-   Reviewed red spruce study system exome capture data
-   Discussed fastq files (DNA seq +q-score)
-   used FASTQC to analyze sequencing runs

### Entry 2: 2023-09-13.

-   FASTQC revealed high quality data for read length
-   eliminated any wonky reads (low Q scores)
-   developed read trimming code by fastp
-   made html files to compare pre- and post- trim
-   set up read mapping of trimmed/clean reads using 'bwa'
